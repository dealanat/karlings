        <h2>by: Karla Duran</h2>

    <p>Do not lose hope in the saying mentioned by Dr. Jose Rizal that the youth is the hope of the people. As part of the next generation that will govern this world, believe in our ability to make a difference. As a future psychologist, I will listen to the complaints of every person looking for help, my arms are open to lean on and my ears will always listen if you need someone by your side in a world where everyone has trampled you. Put your trust in us when I say that we are capable of creating a social change.</p>
